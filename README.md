POSITION_SIZE_PERCENTAGE=0.9           # Use 90% of wallet balance
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE=0.005               # 0.5% slippage tolerance
MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7           # 70% minimum signal confidence

# Solana Configuration
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Database Configuration
